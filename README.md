# UNet

Welcome to this repository explaining the U-Net architecture. You'll find two documents, each explaining the U-Net model from different perspectives. UNet.md explains the U-Net architecture with no assumption of any previous experience with machine learning. Every concept aims to be meticulously explained. UNet_ML.md assumes some previous machine learning background and avoids explaining the intricacies of common machine learning practices. Additionally, you'll find Examples.md explaining the performance of a custom U-Net implementation on a medical imaging dataset, highlighting the successes and deficiencies of the from-scratch architecture. The accompanying code can be found in the [code](https://github.com/ejohansson13/UNet/tree/main/code) folder, and the saved model weights can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/erikj13/Unet-Segmentation-Example-NIFTIs_03). Thanks!
